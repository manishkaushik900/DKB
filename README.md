Hello,
Time Spent: 3,00 hours

Two Things I solved well:
1. Implemented a good Architecture
2. Fetch the data from server using use cases

Two Things that can be improved or added:
1. Use the pagination for this big list
2. Write more test cases


Scope:
1. Implementation of flow
2. Jetpack Compose

I hope to hear from you soon.
